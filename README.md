combining 45 stores including store information and monthly sales. It
has 26673 views on Kaggle and has been downloaded over 3k times.
The data is provided on a weekly basis. Learning about time-based
and space-based factors is essential for Walmart’s weekly sales. It may
help Walmart to find a direction to modify store types or prepare ahead
of time for promotions in order to maximize profit. To visit the original
